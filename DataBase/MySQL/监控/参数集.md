## QPS (Query per second)

QPS = Questions(or Queries)/seconds

mysql > show global status like "Question%";

## TPS (transactions per second)

TPS = (Com_commit + Com_rollback)/seconds

mysql > show global status like "Com_commit";

mysql > show global status like "Com_rollback";

## key Buffer hit rate

mysql>show global status like "key%";

key_buffer_read_hits = (1-key_reads/key_read_requests) * 100%

key_buffer_write_hits = (1-key_writes/key_write_requests) * 100%

## InnoDB Buffer hit rate

mysql> show status like "innodb_buffer_pool_read%";

innodb_buffer_read_hits = (1 - innodb_buffer_pool_reads/innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests) * 100%

## Query Cache hit rate

mysql> show status like "Qcache%";

Query_cache_hits = (Qcahce_hits/(Qcache_hits + Qcache_inserts )) * 100%;

## Table Cache state quantity

mysql> show global status like "open%";

Compare open_tables value and opend_tables

## Thread Cache hit rate

mysql> show global status like "Thread%";

mysql> show global status like "Connections";

Thread_cache_hits = (1 - Threads_created/connections ) * 100%

## locked state

mysql> show global status like "%lock%";

Table_locks_waited/Table_locks_immediate = 0.3% If the ratio is relatively large, it indicates that the lock table obstruction caused serious

Innodb_row_lock_waits innodb row lock, the lock gap is too large may be caused by

## the amount of delay replication

mysql > show slave status

Check the delay time

## Tmp Table status (temporary status table)

mysql > show status like "Create_tmp%";

Created_tmp_disk_tables/Created_tmp_tables ratio is preferably not more than 10%, if the value is relatively large Created_tmp_tables,

Sort sentences may be too much or not enough optimized connection sentence

## Binlog Cache Usage

mysql > show status like "Binlog_cache%";

If Binlog_cache_disk_use value is not 0, you may need to transfer large size binlog_cache_size

## Innodb_log_waits amount

mysql > show status like "innodb_log_waits";

Innodb_log_waits value is not equal to 0, then show innodb log buffer wait due to lack of space
